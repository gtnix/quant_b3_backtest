# Tax Calculation Fix: Preventing Double Application of Loss Carryforward

## Problem Identified

The `compute_tax` method in `portfolio.py` was recalculating taxes without using the `loss_manager`, creating a risk of **double application of loss carryforward** and **divergence between per-trade vs monthly tax calculations**.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **Multiple Tax Calculation Approaches**

The codebase had **three different tax calculation methods**:

1. **`compute_tax()`** (lines 876-959) - **PROBLEMATIC**
   - Used `monthly_summaries` from `aggregate_monthly()`
   - **Did NOT use loss_manager** for loss carryforward
   - Calculated taxes based on pre-calculated `taxable_profit` in `ModalitySummary`
   - **Risk**: The `taxable_profit` in `ModalitySummary` may already have loss carryforward applied

2. **`_calculate_taxes()`** (lines 1231-1429) - **DEPRECATED**
   - Used during individual trade execution (in `sell()` method)
   - **Uses loss_manager** for loss carryforward via `calculate_taxable_amount()`
   - Calculates per-trade taxes with loss carryforward applied
   - **Risk**: May cause double application when used with monthly calculations

3. **`calculate_monthly_tax_liability()`** (lines 1430-1576) - **CORRECT**
   - **Uses loss_manager** for loss carryforward
   - Calculates monthly aggregated taxes correctly
   - **This is the correct approach** for Brazilian tax law

#### 2. **Brazilian Tax Law Requirements**

According to Brazilian tax law (July 2025):
- **Capital gains tax** is calculated on **monthly aggregated profit**, not per trade
- **Loss carryforward** must be applied **once per month** to the total monthly profit
- **IRRF** is calculated on consolidated daily profit per asset for day trades
- **R$ 20,000 exemption** applies to monthly swing trade sales (STOCK assets only)

### The Problem Code

```python
# In compute_tax() - WRONG: Uses pre-calculated taxable_profit
swing_tax = swing_summary.taxable_profit * tax_rule['swing_rate']  # Line 910

# In _calculate_taxes() - CORRECT: Uses loss_manager
taxable_profit, audit_log = self.loss_manager.calculate_taxable_amount(
    gross_profit=profit,
    modality=modality,
    gross_sales=monthly_sales,
    month_ref=month_ref
)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Refactored `compute_tax()` Method**

**Before:**
```python
def compute_tax(self, monthly_summaries, trade_date=None):
    # Direct calculation without loss_manager
    swing_tax = swing_summary.taxable_profit * tax_rule['swing_rate']
    # Risk of double application
```

**After:**
```python
def compute_tax(self, monthly_summaries, trade_date=None):
    # Delegate to correct loss_manager method
    monthly_tax_result = self.calculate_monthly_tax_liability(month_date)
    # Proper loss carryforward application
```

### 2. **Added Deprecation Warning to `_calculate_taxes()`**

```python
def _calculate_taxes(self, profit, trade_type, ...):
    """
    DEPRECATED: This method calculates per-trade taxes which may lead to double application
    of loss carryforward when used in conjunction with monthly tax calculations.
    
    For proper Brazilian tax compliance, use calculate_monthly_tax_liability() instead.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn(
        "DEPRECATED: _calculate_taxes() may cause double application of loss carryforward. "
        "Use calculate_monthly_tax_liability() for proper Brazilian tax compliance.",
        DeprecationWarning,
        stacklevel=2
    )
```

### 3. **Key Changes Made**

1. **`compute_tax()` now delegates to `calculate_monthly_tax_liability()`**
   - Ensures proper loss carryforward application
   - Prevents double taxation
   - Maintains Brazilian tax law compliance

2. **Added `calculation_method` field to tax report**
   - Tracks that the correct method was used
   - Provides audit trail

3. **Enhanced logging**
   - Logs when tax computation is completed using loss_manager delegation
   - Helps with debugging and compliance verification

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Prevents Double Application**
- Loss carryforward is now applied **only once** per month
- Eliminates risk of over-deducting losses

### 2. **Ensures Brazilian Tax Compliance**
- Uses the correct monthly aggregation approach
- Properly handles R$ 20,000 exemption
- Correct IRRF calculation for day trades

### 3. **Maintains Consistency**
- All tax calculations now use the same `loss_manager` approach
- Eliminates divergence between per-trade and monthly calculations

### 4. **Provides Audit Trail**
- Clear indication of which calculation method was used
- Enhanced logging for compliance verification

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

1. **Replace direct calls to `compute_tax()`**:
   ```python
   # Old way (risky)
   tax_result = portfolio.compute_tax(monthly_summaries)
   
   # New way (safe)
   tax_result = portfolio.compute_tax(monthly_summaries)  # Now delegates correctly
   ```

2. **Replace calls to `_calculate_taxes()`**:
   ```python
   # Old way (deprecated)
   taxes = portfolio._calculate_taxes(profit, trade_type, ...)
   
   # New way (recommended)
   monthly_tax = portfolio.calculate_monthly_tax_liability(month_ref)
   ```

### For New Development

1. **Always use `calculate_monthly_tax_liability()`** for tax calculations
2. **Avoid `_calculate_taxes()`** for new code
3. **Use `compute_tax()`** only when you need the specific format it provides

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify loss carryforward is applied only once**:
   ```python
   # Test that monthly tax calculation matches individual trade aggregation
   monthly_tax = portfolio.calculate_monthly_tax_liability(month_ref)
   assert monthly_tax['total']['final_darf_liability'] == expected_total
   ```

2. **Check for deprecation warnings**:
   ```python
   import warnings
   with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
       portfolio._calculate_taxes(...)
       assert len(w) > 0  # Should show deprecation warning
   ```

3. **Validate Brazilian tax compliance**:
   - R$ 20,000 exemption applied correctly
   - IRRF calculated properly for day trades
   - Loss carryforward applied monthly, not per trade

## Files Modified

- `quant_b3_backtest/engine/portfolio.py`
  - Lines 876-959: Refactored `compute_tax()` method
  - Lines 1231-1429: Added deprecation warning to `_calculate_taxes()`

## Compliance Notes

This fix ensures compliance with Brazilian tax law requirements:
- **Monthly aggregation** for capital gains tax calculation
- **Single application** of loss carryforward per month
- **Proper IRRF calculation** for day trades (1% on daily net profit per asset)
- **R$ 20,000 exemption** for swing trade sales (STOCK assets only)
- **R$ 1.00 minimum rule** for swing trade IRRF withholding

The fix eliminates the risk of double taxation and ensures accurate tax calculations according to Brazilian regulations.
